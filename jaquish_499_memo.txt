What I learned: As for what I learned from this assignment using the resources provided, the primary piece of new knowledge is the role of a configuration manager. I have no experience on a truly formal team so seeing the lengths that those working on a large project go through for organization and accountability is surprising, but understandable. I also didn't know before that there were public standards for SCM (like IEEE828). All together there was a lot of great information here, and I understand as difficult as it is sometimes to adhere to strict organization, the benefit is too massive to do otherwise (in all but the smallest projects).

Why configuration management is important:
My previous experience in certain courses (498) as well as in industry have given me a strong appreciation for version control. In 498 my team and I had several instances of bad luck with certain commits that would've been huge problems if we weren't using version control. I have also personally experienced tragedy in my professional life due to my initial lack of organization. SCM is a great benefit for a few reasons:
1. It takes some pressure off of the developers when they're making large changes to a project, as it should be a small issue to undo their changes.
2. It adds accountability for all changes, so issues can be properly attributed and addressed.
3. It offers a great foundation for non-developers to track a project (somewhat).
4. It provides an easy way to access a project for testing in/on different environments.
